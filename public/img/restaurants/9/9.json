There is a vegan option, too. Service was tip top. Each course had fresh utensils. All of this comes with a cost. My companion and I split a bottle of wine and had sparkling water. The final bill before tip was 700 Euros. Before you pass out, look closely at the picture of the menu. Every course was like nothing I've ever tasted. And I live in New Orleans, where weird stuff gets cooked all the time. If you ever get to Germany, it's worth a pilgrimage trip eat at this restaurant."

Both me and my (spoiled ;) friends were absolutely happy and satisfied. Service was attentive and worked together like a greatly organized orchestra. 10/10 experience"

That it took 45 minutes to arrive didn't help either. Between dishes 3 and 4 out of 8 on offer on the complete lunch menu. Not a single word in the way of an apology, despite the swarm of personnel in the service area. Will probably not visit again for a long long time."

It’s like something familiar, something you can relate to, but at the same time, something new and totally surprising. Thank you, Tim Raue & Team."
