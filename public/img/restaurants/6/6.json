As for the food, it was simply divine - each dish a masterpiece of flavor and presentation. Highly recommended for an unforgettable dining experience."

The purple carrot in their Mole is as tasty as beef jerky. The halibut taco is great. Might be THE most impressive and creative 1 star restaurant I have ever tried."

The nine courses on the dinner menu, plus drinks, cheese, and tea, must be finished in three hours. Be their guest if you're happy to be asked over and over again if you're done with your dish, while paying haute cuisine prices."

Clearly the chef puts a lot of effort and creativity into dishes, all well  presented. But not many dishes standout, everything was good but not exceptional, a pleasant experience but will not go back anytime soon."

A really nice touch that made the experience even more special! The service was impeccable, staff were friendly and helpful which you would expect from a restaurant of this calibre. We had the full tasting menu - every dish was better than the last. They were all unique, flavoursome and unlike anything we had ever had before. I would highly recommend this restaurant. I am not sure why some of the reviews are so negative. It is easily the best restaurant we have ever been to and we look forward to going back. Thank you for such an enjoyable experience it was a pleasure to dine with you!"

Great cocktails, the food was inventive yet there was no compromise on flavour. Will be back. Thanks Team Kol!!!"
