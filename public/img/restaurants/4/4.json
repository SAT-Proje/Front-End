All dishes are delicious and display is unique. Highly recommend. Only one thing about desert, maybe can add more creativity to make a fabulous end."

The ambiance exuded elegant sophistication creating a perfect setting for an indulgent evening. The menu showcased a masterful blend of French flavors with innovative twists, each dish a testament to the chef's culinary artistry and showmanship. Impeccable presentation, attentive service, and a carefully curated wine list further elevated the dining experience. This restaurant is truly deserving of their 3 Michelin stars and Worldâ€™s Best restaurant accolades."

The total bill ended up being S$1254 for two people (Epicure Menu), which is a lot by all means, but given the 3-star rating and the fame of the restaurant, it is worth visiting if you have the chance!"

The donut seemed average and greasy, while the impromptu shrimp taco was good, and the onion tart was delightful. The following appetizer, mushroom tea - a mushroom soup infused with truffle, offered a rich and dense mushroom broth with the essence of truffle - was delicious, akin to immersing oneself in a forest basket full of mushrooms."
