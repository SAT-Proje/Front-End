I went for dinner which was a 7 dish surprise course. I ended up eating it more because of the cost than the food. The wine selection was great though"

Very cozy with just the right lighting. Once you walk in, felt very inviting. We had the 7 course dinner for 120€ each courtesy of my buddy. Dishes were light, elegant, & simply delicious. Paired well with 2 glasses of white wine. The service and everything this evening went perfectly. Easily the best venue we dined at since arriving 5 days for Tour de France"
