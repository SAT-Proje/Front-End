We tried different menu items on each visit and got to try so many different things.  My favorite steak was the thin flank steak and the most tender was the tenderloin steak.  I loved all the tomato dishes and the heirloom salad was one we had to repeat.  It was delicious.  The ice cream was excellent as well.  My husband liked the vanilla one best of all.  Our servers really took care of us."

And I do mean PERFECTLY prepared.... Wow! I'll be back (to quote Arnold) before I leave, it deserves to replace another option. I cannot say enough about this incredible restaurant!"

If you're a fan of high-quality steak, you've got to visit this place. From the moment you arrive, you know you're in for a treat. They even give you a glass of champagne while you're waiting to be seated - so classy! And the steaks, oh my! They're easily in my top three, and I've been to some of the best steak houses around. The preparation and quality are simply outstanding, and everything is so fresh and perfectly prepared. They even do a presentation with the baked sweet potatoes! And don't get me started on the wine list - it's extensive and impressive. However, I do have to say that there aren't many options for vegetarians and pescatarians. But if you're a meat-eater, you won't be disappointed. Just be prepared to pay US steak house prices. Don Julio is an absolute must-visit if you're in Buenos Aires. Make sure you make reservations well in advance - this place is a hot ticket!"

I have always had a very special atmosphere in a 50 Best and so the visits have always been an experience. This is not the case with Don Julio. There is a lively and loud atmosphere. The employees are working quickly and hectically as guests are queuing outside to get a table. Small touches are totally missing. The free sparkling wine helps keep the waiting crowd happy. My conclusion - Don Julio is a very good steak house with top cuts, but in my opinion not a 50 best restaurant"
